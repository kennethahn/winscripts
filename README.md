Various bits and pieces for learning about scripting on Windows - checked into Github to learn about git.
Part of it was also used for benchmarks on a development environment with Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server, in a team plagued by severe performance issues. Some bits, and I don't remember which, are copy-pasted from the Internet, so I don't claim authorship of anything.
